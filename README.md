Assignment 3 - myGame

In this assignment, I have made a basic game using libgdx. The plot of the game is that there are randomly generated monsters which travel from right to left, our character can jump and/or attack uing two HUD buttons. As the monster approaches the character, we can kill it using the attack button. If the monster approaches and we are unable to kill it, our character will die and game score will be reset.

Following is the summary of the app development:

Day 1: Setup of libgdx and added background and the character object.

Day 2: Main character is implemented and the animation for his sword swinging is added.

Day 3: Added buttons (HUD) and handled the jump scenario of the character on button press. 

Day 4: Added monsters, they will spawn randomly at Y axis from right to left.

Day 5: Collision detection between the main character and the monster is added.

Day 6: Adding background sound and a start screen for our game

Day 7: Score update, a game over state is handled and drawables were updated. Also the screen bounds issue was fixed.

Day 8: Final commit, code cleanup and collision detection bug fix.
